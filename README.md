# ERC20 Token and Vault Contracts

This repository contains Ethereum smart contracts for ERC20 tokens and a Vault contract to manage token deposits and withdrawals.

## ERC20 Token Contract

The ERC20 token contract in this repository implements the standard ERC20 interface, which allows for the creation of tokens that can be transferred, approved for spending, and queried for balance. It also includes additional functionalities such as minting and burning tokens, if specified in the contract.

### Features:
- Implements the ERC20 standard interface.
- Supports token transfers, allowances, and balance inquiries.
- Customizable functionalities such as minting and burning tokens.

### Usage:
1. **Deployment**: Deploy the ERC20 token contract to the Ethereum network of your choice.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize the token contract with initial supply, name, symbol, and decimal places.
3. **Interacting with the Contract**: Use standard ERC20 functions to transfer tokens, approve spending, and check balances.
4. **Optional Functionalities**: If enabled, utilize additional functionalities such as minting and burning tokens.

## Vault Contract

The Vault contract provided in this repository acts as a secure storage facility for ERC20 tokens, allowing users to deposit and withdraw tokens from the vault. It ensures proper access control and maintains the integrity of deposited tokens.

### Features:
- Secure storage of ERC20 tokens.
- Access control mechanisms to manage deposit and withdrawal permissions.
- Event logging for transparency and auditability.

### Usage:
1. **Deployment**: Deploy the Vault contract to the Ethereum network where your ERC20 token resides.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize the Vault contract with the address of the ERC20 token it will manage.
3. **Deposit**: Users can deposit tokens into the Vault contract using the `deposit` function.
4. **Withdrawal**: Authorized users can withdraw tokens from the Vault using the `withdraw` function.
5. **Access Control**: Manage access permissions by adjusting roles and permissions as needed.
6. **Event Logging**: Monitor deposits, withdrawals, and access control changes through event logs emitted by the contract.
